# Untitled-Nes-Project
Nintendo Entertainment System Project


This is a project I'm working on to build an NES game. We'll see where it goes.

To compile this, I used CC65

The default NES linker only assigns 26 bytes to the zero page instead of the full 256. Change the config header to fix this problem
